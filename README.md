## Features

* **2D Physics Engines:** Gravity, collisions, and fluid dynamics demos.
* **3D Graphics:** WebGL, P5, Matter.js, Cannon.js and Three.js powered scenes.
* **Algorithm Visualizations:** Sorting, pathfinding, and fractal generation.
* **Modular Architecture:** Easily extendable simulation framework.
* **Live Controls:** Adjust parameters in real time via GUI.

---

## Technologies

* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **HTML** for standalone pages with `<script>` tags
* **No build tools or bundlers required** — just open the HTML files in your browser

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-simulations.git
   cd js-simulations
   ```

2. Open a simulation HTML file in your browser:

   * **Simulations:** `2d-demo.html`

No installation or build steps are necessary—just open and explore!

---

## Usage

### Simulations

1. Navigate to directory in the UI or via URL (e.g., `/2d/index.html`).
2. Use the control panel to adjust parameters (velocity, mass, friction, etc.).
3. Observe real-time updates on the canvas.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To add a new simulation:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-simulation
   ```
2. Add your code
3. Update the UI navigation and documentation.
4. Commit your changes and open a pull request.

Please follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and ensure tests (if any) pass.
